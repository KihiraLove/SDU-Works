- Let S be a set of n disjoint line segments in the plane
- let p be a point not on any of the line segments of S
- We wish to determine all line segments of S that p can see, that is, all line segments of S that contain some point q so that the open segment pq doesnâ€™t intersect any p not visible line segment of S
- Give an O(n log n) time algorithm for this problem that uses a rotating half-line with its endpoint at p
